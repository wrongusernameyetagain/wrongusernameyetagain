# Howdy :)

I'm Paul, a ~BI / data analytics / data swiss (french?) army knife~ data guy with a passion for data-driven decision-making and a knack for marketing and growth strategies.
I thrive on turning data into actionable insights to drive business success.

## About Me

- ðŸ’¼ Currently working as a Sr. Data Analyst at [Qonto](https://qonto.com/)
- ðŸ“ˆ Expertise in data analysis, reporting, and visualization using tools like SQL, Python, and your choice of reporting tool (Tableau, Metabase, Data Studio, Excel?)
- ðŸŒ± Always learning new stuff. Gotta keep that nogging oiled.

## What I Do

In my day to day, I:
- Analyze large data-sets and provide actionable insights for growth, marketing and product development.
- Make cool dashboards and reports for stakeholders, so they gain ownership and visibility on their areas of focus.
- Collaborate cross-functionally on product/feature development to provide guidelines on how to define success and measure efficiency. 
- Detect onboarding and retention trends and issues to inform the business on what to do.
